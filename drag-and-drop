Act as an expert Frontend Engineer. 
Build a single, standalone HTML file (index.html) for a language learning game.
IMPORTANT: Do not add any notes, markdown, or explanations at the top or bottom of the HTML file. Output ONLY the raw HTML.

1. GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
-----------------------
- CARDS_PER_ROUND: CARD_COUNT
- LANGUAGE_CODE: Two letter standard code for _LANGUAGE.

2. TECHNICAL STACK & SETUP
--------------------------
- React, ReactDOM, Babel (via CDN).
- TailwindCSS (via CDN).
- Embed all CSS/JS within the file.
- PWA: Include an embedded `manifest.json` (Blob) and Service Worker.
- PWA Icon: Generate a Base64 SVG (Green square, white text LANGUAGE_CODE) for the manifest. Short name: "_GAME".

3. ARCHITECTURE & STATE MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)
---------------------------------------------
- Master Deck: Use a `useRef` (e.g., `deckRef`) to store the full array of words. NEVER use useState for the full deck to prevent stale state issues.
- Round State: Use `useState` only for the current CARDS_PER_ROUND pairs being displayed.
- Mastery Logic: When a match is made without a hint, remove the word from `deckRef.current` immediately.
- Win Condition: Before starting a new round, check if `deckRef.current.length === 0`.
- Round Transition: When the last pair is matched, immediately slice the next CARDS_PER_ROUND words from `deckRef.current` and update the round state. Do not set the state to an empty array in between.
- Shuffle Logic (Derangement): The _LANGUAGE column must be a VALID DERANGEMENT relative to the English column. 


4. LAYOUT & VISUALS
-------------------
- Structure: A flex-column container (h-100dvh).
  1. Header: Fixed height. Contains Score and ALL action buttons (defined below).
  2. Game Area: Flex-1, overflow-y: auto. Contains the two card columns.
- Columns: Two columns (50% width). Left = English, Right = _LANGUAGE.
- Card Content (Strict):
  - Left (English) Card: Display the English text.
  - Right (_LANGUAGE) Card: Display the _LANGUAGE translation. 
- Animations: Use a `.card-wrapper` class. On match, transition `max-height`, `opacity`, and `margin` to 0 to make cards slide up smoothly.
- Mobile View: The entire UI must fit on a single screen without horizontal scrolling.
- Desktop: Set CSS width (viewport) to 400px.
  3. Footer: Fixed height. Contains Copyright (defined below).


5. INTERACTION & EVENTS (STRICT CONSTRAINTS)
--------------------------------------------
You must implement two completely separate event handling systems. Do not unify them.

System A: Desktop (Mouse)
- Draggable Attribute: You MUST use `draggable="true"` on English cards.
- Events: Use `onDragStart` and `onDrop`.
- PROHIBITED: Do NOT use `onMouseDown` or `onMouseMove` for dragging logic on Desktop. This ensures the browser handles the click threshold natively.
- Speaker Icon: Wrap the icon in a button. Add `onMouseDown={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}` to prevent dragging when clicking the speaker.

System B: Mobile (Touch)
- Events: Use `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd`.
- Ghost Card: Render a fixed-position duplicate card following the finger. It must have `pointer-events: none`.
- Scroll Fix: Apply `touch-action: none` via CSS to the draggable cards to prevent page scrolling while dragging.

6. GAME LOGIC
-------------
- Matching: Drag English to _LANGUAGE.
- Success: IDs match -> Play Chime -> Flash Green -> Cards Collapse/Slide Up -> Update Score.
- Fail: IDs mismatch -> Play Buzzer -> Flash Red -> Reset Streak -> Deduct Score.
- Hints:
  - Input: Triggered via the manual Double-Click/Tap logic defined in Section 5.
  - Visuals: The *French* card with that ID flashes bright Orange. The English card does NOT change color.
  - Penalty: No points awarded for this word if hint is used.
  - Effect: Set a global state `hintTargetId`. The *_LANGUAGE* card with that ID flashes Orange. The English card does NOT change color.
  - Penalty: No points awarded for this word if hint is used.

7. AUDIO
--------
- Generation: Web Speech API. Filter voices for `localService: true` (offline support).
- Icons: Place speaker icon immediately after text (inline). 
- Icon Styling: Explicitly set a fixed width/height (e.g., `w-[1em] h-[1em]`) relative to the font. You MUST add the class `flex-shrink-0` (or `shrink-0`) to the icon/button. This prevents the icon from being crushed or resized when text wraps to multiple lines.

8. HEADER & POPUPS
------------------
- Header Layout: Single line, compressed.
- Header Elements (Must include ALL of the following):
  0. "openlang.ai" (bold linked to "/")  
  1. Score Display: "Score X (Y% Learned)".
  2. Mute Icon: Toggles `isMuted` state. Mutes SFX (chime/buzzer) but NOT Text-to-Speech.
  3. Info icon (white lower case serif "i", inside black circle) : Opens Rules modal.
  4. Downward pointing arrow: Opens Install modal. (Hidden if app is running in standalone PWA mode).
  5. Source Button: Button inthe upper right corner (strict), strict Link `<a href="/_LANGUAGE/_GAME/build-instructions.txt" download>Source</a>`.
- Modals: Rules (explain streak bonus), Install iOS+Android (with iOS share icon instructions).
- Closing: Add a global `window.addEventListener('keydown')` to close all modals when "Escape" is pressed.
- Buttons: Uniform color (Blue).

9. COPYRIGHT (Footer)
---------------------
