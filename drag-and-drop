Find 100 interesting, surprising or funny short (maximum 24 words) English quotes from these sources:
The Bible, The Quran, The Talmud, US Founding Documents,
Mao's Little Red Book, Confucius, Bhagavad Gita,
Albert Einstein, Mark Twain, Winston Churchill, Karl Marx,
Vladimir Lenin, Socrates, Plato, Oscar Wilde, Benjamin Franklin,
Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh, Mahatma Gandhi, Thucydides

Find at least 3 quotes from each source, more from the ones toward the top.

Act as an expert Frontend Engineer. 
Build a SINGLE, STANDALONE HTML file based on the game requirements above.
- Use React, ReactDOM, Babel, and TailwindCSS via CDN. 
- Embed all CSS and Javascript within the HTML file. 
- Do not include any markdown formatting (no ```html fences). 
- Output ONLY the raw code.

Create a dataset with these fields:
QUOTE_TEXT | Translation of the quote into LANGUAGE | SOURCE

Add two fields to the dataset with blobs containing the TTS of the QUOTE_TEXT and of its translation.
Use a human-sounding Text-to-Speech service, and OPUS format for the blobs.

An English card contains the entire QUOTE_TEXT and, immediately below it, the SOURCE, in this format:
QUOTE_TEXT 
-- SOURCE (in italics)

The QUOTE_TEXT and the SOURCE should be left-justified. Wrap the SOURCE in a `<span>` with  `mt-0` and `block` classes. Eliminate white space between the Quote and the SOURCE. Eliminate excess white space at the top and bottom of all the cards.

The corresponding LANGUAGE card contains only the translated quote, not the source. It should be left-justified.

Each card should have an icon allowing the OPUS blob to be played. 
To start a new game:
Sort all quotes by their English length.
Take seven cards from the sorted dataset — a contiguous window of 7 adjacent quotes starting from a random element in the dataset. This ensures all displayed quotes have nearly identical lengths, making it impossible to match by size alone.
No column headers.
Two vertical columns that are ALWAYS side-by-side (never stacked). 
Left Side: A column of 7 'Draggable Cards' (LANGUAGE word cards). The Drop Zone cards should be shuffled in relation to the Draggable Cards, so the correct answer does not line up across from its English version.
Right Side: A column of 7  ‘Drop Zone Cards' (English word cards).
The Draggable Cards should be shuffled so the correct answer does not line up across from its English version. The Drop Zone Cards (English) remain in their original order.
Layout: On mobile: ensure both columns are always visible side by side. Reduce the font size and eliminate blank space on the cards if necessary to fit two columns on mobile devices. 
Store the shuffled order in state instead of re-shuffling on every render.
Interaction Visuals and Audio
To determine whether a match is successful, compare quote IDs and not array indexes.
If a match is successful, both the English and LANGUAGE cards should turn green for 0.3 seconds then disappear + pleasant soft  chime sound. 
After a correct match, the matched cards fade out, and the remaining  cards slide up to fill the gap with a smooth transition.
If a match is wrong, the English card should flash red for 0.3 seconds and go back to its place + short buzzer using Web Audio API-generated sound (a  sawtooth wave that drops from 200Hz to 100Hz over 0.3 seconds)
Add touch event handlers to support mobile devices.
Implement Drag and Drop functionality that works on both Desktop and Mobile.
1. For Desktop: Use standard HTML5 `draggable` attributes and events (`onDragStart`, `onDrop`).
2. For Mobile: HTML5 Drag API is not supported. You must implement custom `touchstart`, `touchmove`, and `touchend` handlers.
3. On mobile touch start, create a fixed-position 'ghost' clone of the card that follows the finger coordinates.
4. On mobile touch end, use `document.elementFromPoint(x, y)` to determine if the finger was released over a valid drop zone.
5. Prevent default scrolling behavior while dragging on mobile.
After each round, start a new round with new LANGUAGE and English cards starting from a random card in the quotes dataset.
Give a bonus for streaks. Subtract a penalty for wrong guesses.
Scoring accumulates from round to round. 

Add a Header with these elements (compressed to fit on a single line):
   - Score 
   - Button with the text “Mute”.
   - Button with the text “Source”, link to file /LANG/quotes/source.html (HTML file already exists at that location).
   - Button with the text “Install”, that pops up a window with instructions for install on mobile (using PWA) and explains advantages of PWA install (no ads, off-line). You need to create the content of that pop-up.


Muted color scheme with grays and browns. Sans serif font.

- Create two PWA PNG  icons (192px and 512px) showing a speech bubble with three short lines inside the bubble.
- Install complete PWA support for offline use  (manifest.json, sw.js, icons).

Mobile Layout & Typography:
   Maximize Readability: Use a minimum font size of 15px for main card text on mobile. Do not use `text-xs` for primary content.
   Minimize Whitespace: Reduce padding inside cards (e.g., `p-1.5`) and margins between cards (e.g., `mb-1.5`) to maximize screen real estate for text.
   Compact Verticality: Ensure cards are compact vertically but maintain a minimum touch target height (approx 4.5rem).
   Full Width: Utilize the full width of the mobile screen with minimal container padding.

Do not create a landing page, only the game page.
Place header in upper left corner: “word-play.ai” (large bold) which links to https://word-play.ai.
Center header: “LANGUAGE Quote Match”.
