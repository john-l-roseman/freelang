Add English translations to the dataset. 

Act as an expert Frontend Engineer. Build a single, standalone HTML file for a
language learning game.

IMPORTANT: Do not add any notes at the top of the HTML file.

Technical Stack:
- Use React, ReactDOM, and Babel via CDN.
- Use TailwindCSS via CDN for styling.
- Embed all CSS and Javascript within the HTML file.
- No external assets (images/sounds must be generated or base64).

Game Requirements:

Layout:
- Two vertical columns side-by-side (50% width each). No Column Headers.
- Left Column: 9 Draggable Cards (English). Be sure that the same card does
not appear twice.
- Right Column: 9 Drop Zone Cards (LANGUAGE), shuffled using the Fisher-Yates 
algorithm relative to the left column.
- Store the shuffled Russian card order in state when the round starts, 
not in the render phase.
- Elminate white space above and below words on the cards.
- Verify that the English and LANGUAGE cards have the same height.
- Align cards to the top of the column (flex-start) with a consistent 
fixed gap (e.g., 0.5rem) between them. Do not distribute space between cards.
- Put speaker icons on the English and LANGUAGE cards. Put the icon immediately
after the text, not on a new line.  
Use the browser's Web Speech API for audio generation. 
When selecting a voice, write logic to specifically filter for voices where 
localService is true to ensure the audio works offline without an internet connection.
- On desktop, the layout should appear as it would on a large screen
telephone.

Interaction:
- Drag an English card to the corresponding LANGUAGE card.
- Desktop: Use HTML5 Drag and Drop API.
- Mobile: Implement custom Touch events (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
because HTML5 DnD doesn't work on mobile.
- Mobile Visuals: When dragging on mobile, render a fixed-position "ghost
card" that follows the finger coordinates.
- Hint Interaction: Double-click (Desktop) or Double-tap (Mobile) on an
English card causes the corresponding LANGUAGE card to flash bright orange for 2 seconds. 
The cards remain on the screen, and the user still has to drag and drop the card
before it is removed.

Game Logic:
- Match Success: Compare IDs. If correct: Play a soft chime (Web Audio
API), flash both cards green, remove them from the screen, remaining cards on
both sides slide up to fill the empty space. If no double-click hint was given
for this word, then increment Score (+10 + streak bonus), increment Streak. If
there was a hint, then don’t increment Score.
- Streak Bonus: Equal to the length of the streak.
- Match Fail: If wrong: Play a buzzer (Web Audio API), flash the English
card red for one second, reset Streak, decrement Score (-5).

- Mastery System: When a word is guessed correctly (without double-click
hint), remove it from the main dataset entirely.

-Rounds: When all 9 pairs are matched, automatically start a new round. 
IMPORTANT: Detect round completion explicitly within the match logic 
(not via useEffect). Pass the updated deck directly to the new round function 
to ensure the next set of cards loads immediately without a blank screen.

After all words are correctly guessed, pop up a message saying “Congratulations!
You've learned all words!”. When the player clicks OK, redirect to /LANGUAGE

Visuals:
- Muted Green color scheme.
- Sans-serif fonts.
- Smooth CSS transitions for disappearing cards.

PWA Features:
- Include a `manifest.json` (embedded as a Blob).
- Include a Service Worker (embedded) to cache the CDNs for offline use.
- Create a minimalist SVG string in the JavaScript (a square with a Green
background color matching the game theme and the two letter country code for the
origin country of LANGUAGE in white text).
Convert this SVG string to a Base64 Data URI using the btoa() function.
Inject this Data URI into the embedded manifest.json blob as the src for icons of
sizes "192x192" and "512x512".
In the generated manifest.json, set the short_name property to "LANGUAGE GAME".

Add a Header with these elements (compressed to fit on a single line):
- Score + percent of words that have been learned (eliminated from the deck).
For example: “Score 65 10.3% Learned”. Update the % learned after every correct
guess. Score should start at 0.0 when the game begins.
- Button with the text “Mute”. The Mute button should only suppress the buzzer
and chime sounds, not the Text-to-Speech.
- Button with the text “Rules”, pop-up with rules and scoring summary. You need
to create the content of that pop-up. Rules should include explanation of how the
streak bonus is calculated.
- Button with the text “Install”, that pops up a window with instructions for
install on mobile (using PWA). You need to create the content for this pop-up.
Instructions for iOS should describe the share icon as an arrow going up. After
instructions for installation on iOS and Android, it should list the advantages
of PWA.  This button should not appear when the game is being used as PWA.
- Button with the text “Source”, link to file /LANGUAGE/Intermediate/source.html (HTML
file already exists at that location).

All buttons should be the same color.
Pop-ups should close with the Escape key.

Fixes Suggested by Gemini

Mobile Drag Fix:
1. CSS Requirement: Apply the CSS property touch-action: none; specifically to
the English Draggable Cards. This is critical to prevent the browser from
scrolling the page when the user tries to drag a card.
2. Event Handling: Inside the onTouchMove event handler, you must call
e.preventDefault() conditional on whether a drag is currently active (i.e.,
if the 'ghost card' exists). This ensures that the custom drag logic
overrides the native browser scrolling."

Robust Double-Click/Tap Hint Logic:
Desktop: Use the standard React onDoubleClick event listener on the English cards
to trigger the hint.
Mobile (Custom Double-Tap):
Standard dblclick events are unreliable on touch devices and often conflict with
zooming. Implement custom logic within the touchstart handler:
Use a useRef to store the timestamp of the lastTap.
On touchstart, compare the current time to lastTap.
If the difference is less than 300ms, treat it as a Double Tap.
Crucial: If a Double Tap is detected, trigger the hint logic and return
immediately to abort the drag-and-drop ghost generation.
If the difference is greater than 300ms, update lastTap to the current time and
proceed with the standard Drag/Touch logic.

1.  **Two-Stage Animation Logic:* Use `successIds` state to handle the "Green
Flash" phase and a `matchedIds` state to handle the "Slide Up/Collapse" phase.
2.  **CSS Transitions:** Add a `.card-wrapper` class. When a match is confirmed,
the wrapper transitions its `max-height`, `opacity`, and `margin` to 0. This
causes the remaining cards to smoothly slide up to fill the empty space.
3.  **DOM Management:** Instead of replacing matched cards with fixed-height
placeholders (which prevented sliding), the matched cards remain in the DOM but
collapse to zero size.

To ensure Mobile Drag and Drop works correctly in React/HTML5 without external
libraries:
1. Ghost Element CSS: The fixed-position "ghost" card following the finger MUST
have the CSS property `pointer-events: none`.
2. Drop Detection Logic: In the `touchend` event, use
`document.elementFromPoint(e.changedTouches[0].clientX,
e.changedTouches[0].clientY)` to find the target.
3. DOM Traversal: The element found by `elementFromPoint` might be a child (like
a text <span> or icon).

Always use `element.closest('.drop-zone')` (or specific selector) to resolve
the actual drop container.
4. Scroll Prevention: Apply `touch-action: none` to the draggable element via
CSS. This prevents the browser from interpreting the drag as a page scroll.

Crucial Data Structure Requirement:
Use a useRef hook (e.g., deckRef) to store the main dataset of 250 words. 
Do not use useState for the main deck.
Why: This prevents "stale state" bugs where the game thinks the deck is 
empty after the first round.
Flow:
Initialize deckRef.current with the full shuffled dataset on mount.
When a word is mastered (guessed without hint), remove it from 
deckRef.current using .splice() or .filter() immediately.
To start a new round, simply slice the first 9 items from 
deckRef.current and pass them to the currentRound state.

Rounds Logic:
Track the number of matches in the current round using a local 
variable or ref (not state).
When the last match occurs:
Immediately select the next batch of words from deckRef.current.
Call setCurrentRound(...) with these new words.
Do not wait for animations or useEffects to trigger the next round. 
Force the update immediately.

Safety Check: Inside the function that starts a new round, 
check if deckRef.current.length is greater than 0. If words remain 
but are fewer than 9, take all of them. Only trigger the "Win" 
message if deckRef.current.length is exactly 0.

By moving the deck to a useRef, the AI will generate code that 
accesses the data directly in memory, ensuring that when Round 1 
finishes, Round 2 definitely receives the remaining words.

Mobile Viewport & Footer Layout:
Main Container: Set the top-level app container to height: 100dvh, display: flex, 
and flex-direction: column.
Three Explicit Sections: The Main Container must have exactly three direct children:
Header: flex: none (Fixed height).
Game Area: flex: 1 and overflow-y: auto. Crucial: The game cards must reside here. 
This ensures only the middle section scrolls while the header and footer stay pinned.
Footer: flex: none (Fixed height). Crucial: Place the copyright text here. Ensure 
it has a distinct background color and z-index: 10 to sit above any other elements.

Round Transition Logic:
When the last match of a round is completed:
1. Immediately filter the main word dataset (stored in the ref) to remove 
   only the words that were correctly guessed WITHOUT using hints
2. Add defensive logging to verify the dataset still contains words:
   - Log the length of the remaining dataset
   - Log a sample of the next words to be used
3. Use a setTimeout with 500ms delay before starting the next round
4. Inside the setTimeout, call the function that starts a new round

The new round function must:
- First check if the dataset has any remaining words
- If words remain, take up to 9 words from the dataset
- Immediately update the state with these new words (never set to empty array)
- Create a shuffled version for the second column
- Reset match tracking for the new round

Common mistake to avoid:
Do NOT clear the current round state to an empty array before starting 
the new round. This causes a blank screen. Instead, directly replace the 
current round with the new set of words in a single state update.
