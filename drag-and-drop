Act as an expert Frontend Engineer. 
Build a single, standalone HTML file (index.html) for a language learning game.
IMPORTANT: Do not add any notes, markdown, or explanations at the top or bottom of the HTML file. Output ONLY the raw HTML.

1. GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
-----------------------
- CARDS_PER_ROUND: _CARD_COUNT
- BASE_LANGUAGE: _BASE_LANGUAGE
- TARGET_LANGUAGE: _TARGET_LANGUAGE
- LANGUAGE_CODE: Two letter standard code for _TARGET_LANGUAGE (All Caps).
- GA_MEASUREMENT_ID: "G-WFWF326Q9H"  


2. TECHNICAL STACK & SETUP
--------------------------
- React, ReactDOM, Babel (via CDN).
- TailwindCSS (via CDN).
- Embed all CSS/JS within the file.
- Analytics: Include the standard Google Analytics 4 (gtag.js) script in the <head>. Initialize `window.dataLayer` and config using the `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`. 
- PWA: Include an embedded `manifest.json` (Blob) and Service Worker.
- PWA Icon: Generate a Base64 SVG (Green square, white text "LANGUAGE_CODE") for the manifest. Short name: "_GAME".


3. ARCHITECTURE & STATE MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)
---------------------------------------------
- Master Deck Initialization: Initialize `deckRef` using a Fisher-Yates shuffle of the full `RAW_DATA` array. Do NOT use the sorted data.
- Round State: Use `useState` only for the current CARDS_PER_ROUND pairs.
- Mastery Logic: When a match is made (no hint), remove the word from `deckRef.current` immediately.
- Win Condition: Check if `deckRef.current.length === 0` before starting a round.
- Round Transition: When last pair matches, slice next batch from `deckRef`.
- _TARGET_LANGUAGE Column Logic: Must be a VALID DERANGEMENT (shuffled so no French card lines up horizontally with its English counterpart). CRITICAL: If the batch size is less than 2 (e.g., the final card), return the batch as-is without attempting to derange. This prevents an infinite loop.


4. LAYOUT & VISUALS
-------------------
- Structure: A flex-column container (h-100dvh).
  1. Header: Fixed height. Contains Score and ALL action buttons (defined below).
  2. Game Area: Flex-1, overflow-y: auto. Contains the two card columns.
- Columns: Two columns (50% width). Left = English, Right = _TARGET_LANGUAGE.
- Card Content (Strict):
   - Left (English) Card: Display the English text.
   - Right (French) Card: Display the French translation.
- Animations: Use a `.card-wrapper` class. On match, transition `max-height`, `opacity`, and `margin` to 0 to make cards slide up smoothly.
- Mobile View: The entire UI must fit on a single screen without horizontal scrolling.
- Desktop: Set CSS width (viewport) to 400px.
  3. Footer: Fixed height. Contains Copyright (defined below).

5. INTERACTION & EVENTS (STRICT CONSTRAINTS)
--------------------------------------------
You must implement two completely separate event handling systems. Do not unify them.

System A: Desktop (Mouse)
- Draggable Attribute: You MUST conditionally set `draggable={!isTouch}`. Detect touch capability on mount. If the device is touch-enabled, `draggable` MUST be false. This is critical to prevent the native "Long Press to Drag" behavior on mobile.
- Events: Use `onDragStart` and `onDrop`.
- PROHIBITED: Do NOT use `onMouseDown` or `onMouseMove` for dragging logic on Desktop.

System B: Mobile (Touch)
- Events: Use `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd`.
- Conflict Prevention: Add `onContextMenu={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); }}` to the cards to block the system menu on long press.
- CSS Safety: Apply `user-select: none` and `-webkit-touch-callout: none` to the cards to prevent text selection or iOS magnifying glass.
- Scroll Fix: Apply `touch-action: none` via CSS to the draggable cards.
- Drop Detection: Use `document.elementFromPoint` in `onTouchEnd`. Always look for `.closest('.drop-zone')`.

Double-Tap Implementation (CRITICAL):
Do NOT use a custom hook (e.g., useDoubleTap) inside the .map loop.
Implementation: Use a single useRef at the component level to store { id: null, time: 0 }.
Logic:
1. Desktop: Handle logic inside the standard `onClick` event.
2. Mobile: Handle logic at the very top of `onTouchStart` as a Guard Clause.
   - Check if `id === ref.current.id` and `Date.now() - ref.current.time < 300`.
   - IF YES (Double Tap): 
     a) Trigger the hint.
     b) Reset the ref to { id: null, time: 0 }.
     c) Call `e.preventDefault()`.
     d) RETURN IMMEDIATELY. (Do not execute the card creation or drag logic).
   - IF NO: 
     a) Update the ref with { id, time: Date.now() }.
     b) Proceed to execute the standard Card/Drag logic.

6. GAME LOGIC
-------------
- Matching: Drag English to _TARGET_LANGUAGE.
- Success: IDs match -> Play Chime -> Flash Green -> _TARGET_LANGUAGE text is spoken (if no hint was given for this card) -> Cards Collapse/Slide Up -> Update Score.
- Fail: IDs mismatch -> Play Buzzer -> Flash Red -> Reset Streak -> Deduct Score.
- Hints:
  - Input: Triggered via the manual Double-Click/Tap logic defined in Section 5.
  - Visuals: The *_TARGET_LANGUAGE* card with that ID flashes bright Orange. The English card does NOT change color.
  - Audio: _TARGET_LANGUAGE text is spoken.
  - Penalty: No points awarded for this word if hint is used.
  - Effect: Set a global state `hintTargetId`. The *_TARGET_LANGUAGE* card with that ID flashes Orange for 2 seconds. The English card does NOT change color. The _TARGET_LANGUAGE card is spoken.
  - Penalty: No points awarded for this word if hint is used.

7. AUDIO
--------
- Generation: Web Speech API. Filter voices for `localService: true` (offline support).


8. HEADER & POPUPS
------------------
- Header Layout: Single line, compressed.
- Header Elements (Must include ALL of the following):
  0. "openlang.ai" (bold linked to "/")  
  1. Score Display: "Score X (Learned Y%)".
  2. Mute Button: The exact text "MUTE". Toggles `isMuted` state, mutes all sound, text toggles to "UNMUTE". 
  3. Info icon (large question mark, inside black circle): Opens Info modal.
  5. Source Button: Button in the upper right corner (strict), strict Link `<a href="/_TARGET_LANGUAGE/_GAME/build-instructions.txt" download>SOURCE</a>`.
- Info Modal: 
1. Explain rules (point scoring for correct and penalty for wrong answer, streak bonus, hint rules, no points for hint).
2. Describe how to install on mobile: iOS: share icon (show the icon) -> Add to Home Screen, Android: Three dot menu -> Add to Home Screen.
3. Add a button "INSTALL" that is hidden by default. You only show that button if the browser says the app is installable. The INSTALL button launches the install process on Android phones where automatic PWA install is supported.

- Closing: Add a global `window.addEventListener('keydown')` to close all modals when "Escape" is pressed.
- Buttons: Uniform color (Blue).
