Create a dataset with these fields:
QUOTE_TEXT | Translation of QUOTE_TEXT into LANGUAGE | AUTHOR

Define two sets of cards:
1. An English card contains the entire QUOTE_TEXT and, immediately 
following it, and em-dash and the AUTHOR, in this format: 
QUOTE_TEXT --AUTHOR (in italics)

2. The corresponding LANGUAGE card contains only the translated QUOTE_TEXT, 
not the AUTHOR.  All text should be left-justified (or right justfiied for
right-to-left scripts).
