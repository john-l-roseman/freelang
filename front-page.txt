Use the Tailwind 'Stone' color palette as the foundation 
(bg-stone-50 for page background, text-stone-800 for primary text, 
border-stone-300 for dividers). 
This gives a warm, paper-like, intellectual feel.

Use an Editorial/Magazine theme: Use serif fonts for Headings and sans-serif 
Use deep red for headings and titles.

Do not display any commentary or notes.

-------
Header & Favicon
-------
In the HTML <head>:
1. Set the Title to "OpenLang.ai".
2. Create a Favicon using a Data URI (data:image/svg+xml...).
   The Data URI should contain a simple SVG with the character "文".
   - Color: Deep Red (#991b1b) to match the logo.
   - Font: Serif (to match the intellectual theme).
   - Background: White.

-------
Top Bar
-------
Make the top bar the same width as Main Content.

Logo Construction:
Create an inline SVG of the Chinese character "文" (Wen). 
Use a viewBox="0 0 109 109".
Inside the SVG, create a group <g> with stroke="currentColor", fill="none", stroke-width="6", stroke-linecap="round", stroke-linejoin="round".

Use the following 4 specific <path> elements (These are the official KanjiVG vectors for this character):
1. Top Dot: 
   d="M49.6,14.64c2.63,1.06,6.31,4.99,7.39,8.42"
2. Horizontal Bar: 
   d="M19.5,42c3.59,1.14,7.03,0.92,10.77,0.61c16.51-1.37,36.98-4.61,54.12-5.33c3.52-0.15,7.73,0.39,10.61,1.72"
3. Left Sweep: 
   d="M52,43c0.75,1.5,0.28,3.22-0.66,5.39C45.42,61.99,30.12,83.88,10.5,93"
4. Right Sweep: 
   d="M54,42.5c7.25,8.88,28.16,30.33,40.54,34.92c2.76,1.02,4.96,1.46,7.71,1.58"

Logo Styling & Animation:
1. Set the SVG text color to a Deep Red (text-red-800).
2. Add a CSS keyframe animation called "drawStroke".
   - 0%: stroke-dashoffset: 250;
   - 100%: stroke-dashoffset: 0;
3. Apply this animation to all <path> elements with these properties:
   - stroke-dasharray: 250;
   - animation-fill-mode: forwards;
   - animation-timing-function: linear;
   - animation-iteration-count: 1;
4. Stagger the animation delays so the strokes write in the correct order:
   - Path 1: delay 0s, duration 0.3s
   - Path 2: delay 0.3s, duration 0.5s
   - Path 3: delay 0.8s, duration 0.5s
   - Path 4: delay 1.3s, duration 0.5s


Layout:
Left: The animated SVG Logo, followed by “openlang.ai” in larger bold type.
Center: “Hundreds of open-source language-learning games” (large italic serif text).
CTA: Button with the text “Source”, link that button for downloading with this format:
<a href="/front-page.txt" download="front-page.txt">
(The build-instructions.txt file already exists at that location).

------------
Main Content
------------
Two column layout. 

First column:
Display all character sets natively (Chinese, Arabic, Korean, etc).
Create a dataset of languages containing one field called “LANGUAGE”:
Chinese Spanish French German Portuguese Ukrainian Korean Japanese Persian Hindi
Arabic Swahili

Add a second field NATIVE_NAME to the dataset containing the name of the language
in the language itself, using the language’s primary character set.

Create buttons for each language in this format:
NATIVE_NAME (bold, large) above LANGUAGE (medium) compact styling.
Link the buttons to an internal URL in this format: /LANGUAGE

Style the buttons as a grid of cards with the same color. 

Create a language selection block containing all of the language buttons in a
grid. Maximum width of the grid on desktop: 4 buttons. Call this container
“MAIN_LANGUAGES”.

Create another dataset of additional languages containing:
Azerbaijani Belarusian Bengali Bulgarian Burmese Catalan Czech Danish Dutch Estonian
Georgian Greek Hausa Hungarian Italian Lao Latin Latvian Lithuanian
Madurese Malay Malayalam Norwegian Pashto Polish Punjabi Romanian Russian
Serbo-Croatian Sindhi Slovak Somali Swedish Tagalog Tamil Telugu Thai Turkish Urdu
Vietnamese

Create another block with language buttons using the same method as
“MAIN_LANGUAGE”.
Call this container “ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES”. Make it collapsible.

Language Picker Block:
Display the container “MAIN_LANGUAGES”, with the header "Choose a Language".
Below that, display “ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES”, collapsed by default, 
with the heading “More Languages”.

Technology Stack:
Create a table with two columns: 
Technology|How It's Used
Populate the table with these technologies (add the second column yourself):
Gemini 3 Pro,React, ReactDOM, Babel, TailwindCSS, PWA, Text-to-Speech

Display the column with the header "Technology Stack".


Second Column:
Create a block "Open Source for Everyone". 
Style this block with a subtle border and a light background (bg-white) 
to differentiate it from the main list.
Link "vibe coding" to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding
--------------
The Open Source movement was a revolution for programmers, allowing 
them to reuse existing tools and systems. With the advent of vibe coding, 
anyone can build with Open Source.

Every page on this site has a "Source" button in the top corner. You can download
the source text for any game, change it to for your needs, and produce a fully-functional 
customized game.
--------------

Constraint: Do not use target="_blank" on any links. All links must open in 
the current window unless the user chooses otherwise.

------
Footer
------
Left Footer:
Title: About the Site Logo 
------------------------------------------
The Chinese wén character (文) signifies "literature," "culture," or "writing".
It is part of the name of the Chinese language itself (中文).
------------------------------------------

Right Footer:
Add copyright text as footer on a single line in small print. The copyright text
should be in a container independent of the container containing the game. On
desktop, the copyright text should be inside the mobile window.
