Use the Tailwind 'Stone' color palette (bg-stone-50 for background, 
text-stone-800 for text, border-stone-300 for elements). This gives 
a warm, paper-like, intellectual feel."

Main Content

Two column layout. 
First column:
Display all character sets natively (Chinese, Arabic, Korean, etc).
Create a dataset of languages containing one field called “LANGUAGE”:
Chinese Spanish French German Portuguese Ukrainian Korean Japanese Persian Hindi
Arabic Swahili

Add a second field NATIVE_NAME to the dataset containing the name of the language
in the language itself, using the language’s primary character set.

Create buttons for each language  in this format:
NATIVE_NAME (bold, large) above LANGUAGE (medium) compact styling
Link the buttons to an internal URL in this format:  /LANGUAGE

Create a language selection block containing all of the language buttons in a
grid. Maximum width of the grid on desktop: 4 buttons. Call this container
“MAIN_LANGUAGES”.

Create another dataset of additional languages containing:
Azerbaijani Belarusian Bengali Bulgarian Burmese Catalan Czech Danish Dutch Estonian
Georgian Greek Hausa Hungarian Indonesian Italian Lao Latin Latvian Lithuanian
Madurese Malay Malayalam Norwegian Pashto Polish Punjabi Romanian Russian
Serbo-Croatian Sindhi Slovak Somali Swedish Tagalog Tamil Telugu Thai Turkish Urdu
Vietnamese

Create another block with language buttons using the same method as
“MAIN_LANGUAGE”.
Call this container “ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES”.  Make it collapsible.

Language Picker Block:
Display the container “MAIN_LANGUAGES”, with the header "Choose a Language".
Below that, display “ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES”, collapsed by default, 
with the heading “More Languages”.

Second Column:
Create a block "Open Source for Everyone". 
--------------
The Open Source movement was a revolution for programmers, allowing 
them to reuse exiting tools and systems. With the advent of vibecoding, 
anyone can build with Open Source.

Every page on this site has a "Source" button in the top corner. You can download
the source text for any game, change it to for your needs, and produce a fully-functional 
customized game (works with Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude).
--------------
Link Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude to their respective home pages.

Footer
------
Add copyright text as footer on a single line in small print. The copyright text
should be in a container independent of the container containing the game. On
desktop, the copyright text should be inside the mobile window.
