Use the Tailwind 'Stone' color palette as the foundation 
(bg-stone-50 for page background, text-stone-800 for primary text, 
border-stone-300 for dividers). 
This gives a warm, paper-like, intellectual feel.

To add a colorful but restrained touch, use a "Muted Mosaic" 
palette for the language buttons. Cycle through soft, 
low-saturation backgrounds (e.g., bg-orange-100, bg-emerald-100, 
bg-sky-100, bg-rose-100, bg-violet-100) paired with dark text (text-stone-900).

Use an Editorial/Magazine theme: Use serif fonts for Headings and sans-serif for UI elements.
Do not display any commentary or notes.

Top Bar

Make the top bar the same width as Main Content.
Create an SVG image of the Chinese Wen character. Style the SVG in 
deep red (text-red-800) to resemble a traditional ink seal. Use it as a Logo.

Left: The Logo, followed by “openlang.ai” in larger bold type.
Center: “Hundreds of open source language learning games”
CTA: A button with the text “Source”, link to file /source.html. 
Style this button solid and dark (bg-stone-800 text-white rounded-full) 
to contrast with the page.

Two column layout. 

First column:
Display all character sets natively (Chinese, Arabic, Korean, etc).
Create a dataset of languages containing one field called “LANGUAGE”:
Chinese Spanish French German Portuguese Ukrainian Korean Japanese Persian Hindi
Arabic Swahili

Add a second field NATIVE_NAME to the dataset containing the name of the language
in the language itself, using the language’s primary character set.

Create buttons for each language in this format:
NATIVE_NAME (bold, large) above LANGUAGE (medium) compact styling.
Link the buttons to an internal URL in this format: /LANGUAGE

Style the buttons as a grid of cards. Assign one of the "Muted Mosaic" 
pastel background colors to each card randomly or sequentially to create 
a colorful, tile-like effect. 

Create a language selection block containing all of the language buttons in a
grid. Maximum width of the grid on desktop: 4 buttons. Call this container
“MAIN_LANGUAGES”.

Create another dataset of additional languages containing:
Azerbaijani Belarusian Bengali Bulgarian Burmese Catalan Czech Danish Dutch Estonian
Georgian Greek Hausa Hungarian Indonesian Italian Lao Latin Latvian Lithuanian
Madurese Malay Malayalam Norwegian Pashto Polish Punjabi Romanian Russian
Serbo-Croatian Sindhi Slovak Somali Swedish Tagalog Tamil Telugu Thai Turkish Urdu
Vietnamese

Create another block with language buttons using the same method and coloring style as
“MAIN_LANGUAGE”.
Call this container “ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES”. Make it collapsible.

Language Picker Block:
Display the container “MAIN_LANGUAGES”, with the header "Choose a Language".
Below that, display “ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES”, collapsed by default, 
with the heading “More Languages”.

Second Column:
Create a block "Open Source for Everyone". 
Style this block with a subtle border and a light background (bg-white) 
to differentiate it from the main list.
--------------
The Open Source movement was a revolution for programmers, allowing 
them to reuse exiting tools and systems. With the advent of vibecoding, 
anyone can build with Open Source.

Every page on this site has a "Source" button in the top corner. You can download
the source text for any game, change it to for your needs, and produce a fully-functional 
customized game (works with Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude).
--------------
Link Google Gemini and Anthropic Claude to their respective home pages.

Footer
------
Add copyright text as footer on a single line in small print. The copyright text
should be in a container independent of the container containing the game. On
desktop, the copyright text should be inside the mobile window.
