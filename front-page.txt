Use the Tailwind 'Stone' color palette as the foundation 
(bg-stone-50 for page background, text-stone-800 for primary text, 
border-stone-300 for dividers). 
This gives a warm, paper-like, intellectual feel.

Use an Editorial/Magazine theme: Use serif fonts for Headings and sans-serif 
for UI elements.  Do not display any commentary or notes.

Logo Construction:
Create an inline SVG of the Chinese character "文" (Wen). 
Use a viewBox="0 0 100 100".
Inside the SVG, create a group <g> with stroke="currentColor", fill="none", stroke-width="8", stroke-linecap="round" and stroke-linejoin="round".
Use the following 4 specific <path> elements to form a geometric, Sans-Serif style character:
1. Top Dot: d="M50 15 L50 35"
2. Horizontal Bar: d="M20 35 L80 35"
3. Left Leg: d="M50 35 Q 35 65 20 90"
4. Right Leg: d="M50 35 Q 65 65 80 90"

Logo Styling & Animation:
1. Set the SVG text color to a Deep Red (text-red-800).
2. Add a CSS keyframe animation called "drawStroke".
   - 0%: stroke-dashoffset: 100;
   - 100%: stroke-dashoffset: 0;
3. Apply this animation to the <path> elements with these properties:
   - stroke-dasharray: 100;
   - animation-duration: 0.8s;
   - animation-fill-mode: forwards;
   - animation-timing-function: ease-out;
   - animation-iteration-count: 1;
4. Stagger the animation delays so the strokes appear one by one:
   - Path 1: delay 0s
   - Path 2: delay 0.3s
   - Path 3: delay 0.6s
   - Path 4: delay 0.9s

Layout:
Left: The animated SVG Logo, followed by “openlang.ai” in larger bold type.
Center: “Hundreds of open-source language-learning games” (large italic serif text).
CTA: A button with the text “Source”, link to file /source.html. 
Style this button solid and dark (bg-stone-800 text-white rounded-full) 
to contrast with the page.

Main Content
------------
Two column layout. 

First column:
Display all character sets natively (Chinese, Arabic, Korean, etc).
Create a dataset of languages containing one field called “LANGUAGE”:
Chinese Spanish French German Portuguese Ukrainian Korean Japanese Persian Hindi
Arabic Swahili

Add a second field NATIVE_NAME to the dataset containing the name of the language
in the language itself, using the language’s primary character set.

Create buttons for each language in this format:
NATIVE_NAME (bold, large) above LANGUAGE (medium) compact styling.
Link the buttons to an internal URL in this format: /LANGUAGE

Style the buttons as a grid of cards with the same color. 

Create a language selection block containing all of the language buttons in a
grid. Maximum width of the grid on desktop: 4 buttons. Call this container
“MAIN_LANGUAGES”.

Create another dataset of additional languages containing:
Azerbaijani Belarusian Bengali Bulgarian Burmese Catalan Czech Danish Dutch Estonian
Georgian Greek Hausa Hungarian Indonesian Italian Lao Latin Latvian Lithuanian
Madurese Malay Malayalam Norwegian Pashto Polish Punjabi Romanian Russian
Serbo-Croatian Sindhi Slovak Somali Swedish Tagalog Tamil Telugu Thai Turkish Urdu
Vietnamese

Create another block with language buttons using the same method as
“MAIN_LANGUAGE”.
Call this container “ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES”. Make it collapsible.

Language Picker Block:
Display the container “MAIN_LANGUAGES”, with the header "Choose a Language".
Below that, display “ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES”, collapsed by default, 
with the heading “More Languages”.

Second Column:
Create a block "Open Source for Everyone". 
Style this block with a subtle border and a light background (bg-white) 
to differentiate it from the main list.
--------------
The Open Source movement was a revolution for programmers, allowing 
them to reuse exiting tools and systems. With the advent of vibecoding, 
anyone can build with Open Source.

Every page on this site has a "Source" button in the top corner. You can download
the source text for any game, change it to for your needs, and produce a fully-functional 
customized game.

Footer
------
Add copyright text as footer on a single line in small print. The copyright text
should be in a container independent of the container containing the game. On
desktop, the copyright text should be inside the mobile window.
