Main Content

Two column layout. 
First column:
Display all character sets natively (Chinese, Arabic, Korean, etc).
Create a dataset of languages containing one field called “LANGUAGE”:
Chinese Spanish French German Portuguese Ukrainian Korean Japanese Persian Hindi
Arabic Swahili

Add a second field NATIVE_NAME to the dataset containing the name of the language
in the language itself, using the language’s primary character set.

Create buttons for each language  in this format:
NATIVE_NAME (bold, large) above LANGUAGE (medium) compact styling
Link the buttons to an internal URL in this format:  /LANGUAGE

Create a language selection block containing all of the language buttons in a
grid. Maximum width of the grid on desktop: 4 buttons. Call this container
“MAIN_LANGUAGES”.

Create another dataset of languages containing:
Azerbaijani Belarusian Bengali Bulgarian Burmese Czech Danish Dutch Estonian
Georgian Greek Hausa Hungarian Indonesian Italian Lao Latin Latvian Lithuanian
Madurese Malay Malayalam Nepali Norwegian Pashto Polish Punjabi Romanian Russian
Serbo-Croatian Sindhi Somali Swedish Tagalog Tamil Telugu Thai Turkish Urdu
Vietnamese

Create another block with language buttons using the same method as
“MAIN_LANGUAGE”.
Call this container “ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES”.  Make it collapsible.

Language Picker Block:
Display the container “MAIN_LANGUAGES”, with the header "Choose a Language".
Below that, display “ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES”, collapsed by default, 
with the heading “More Languages”.




Second Column:
Create a block "Open Source for Everyone" which expanding on this: 
--------------
Explain how the Open Source movement was a revolution for programmers, allowing 
them to build on exiting libraries and systems. With the advent of vibecoding, 
Open Source can be used by anyone, by customizing English language prompts.

Every page on this site has a "Source" button in the top corner. You can download
the source text for any game, change to for your needs, and produce a fully-functional 
customized game. This works for Google Gemini 3 Pro and Anthropic Claude Opus 4.5.
--------------
Show the block with logos from Google Gemini 3 and Anthropic Claude Opus.
