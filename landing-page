Create a dataset of Categories: "Quote Match","Word Match","Phrase Match"
Add a field with an SVG graphic clip art representation of the Category.

Create three blocks, one for each category

Create a dataset with a single field called NAME, containing these elements: GAMES.

Add another field IMAGE to the dataset containing an SVG representation of a 
thumbnail-size clip-art image that represents the NAME field in the context of 
language learning.

Display a grid of buttons that contain NAME and IMAGE. Link each button to this 
URL: “/LANGUAGE/NAME” (where NAME is the text of the first field).

Middle header: LANGUAGE Language Learning
Left side header: openlang.ai  (large bold)
Put a button with the text “Source” in the upper right corner, 
link to /LANGUAGE/source.html (HTML file already exists at that location).

Do not add any notes at the top of the index.html file.
