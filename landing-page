Create a variable called INSTRUCTIONS with the text “Drag the English cards to
the right column, double-tap card for hint.”.

Add this text to the INSTRUCTIONS variable (separated by a horizontal rule): the
translation into Belarusian of the original INSTRUCTIONS text.

Display INSTRUCTIONS in a block.

Create a dataset with a single field called NAME, containing these elements:
Beginner, Longer Phrases, Neologisms, Quotes, Short Phrases.

Add another field IMAGE to the dataset containing an SVG representation of a
thumbnail-size clip-art image that represents the NAME field in the context of
language learning.

Display a grid of buttons that contain NAME and IMAGE. Link each button to this
URL: “/Belarusian/NAME” (where NAME is the text of the first field).

Middle header: Belarusian Language Learning

Left side header: openlang.ai  (large bold)

Put a button with the text “Source” in the upper right corner, link to
/Belarusian/source.html (HTML file already exists at that location).

Do not add any notes at the top of the index.html file.
